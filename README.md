# Clue_IOS_Application

This project was started because we ran out of detective note taking sheets for the game of Clue. The goal was simple, use the memory and logic capabilities of a computer to keep track of the questions and cards of every player in the game and make the most out of this information. The basic layout for the program is to (1) record which cards are in the userâ€™s hand, (2), record the questions asked by every player, and (3), display the results of the computer deductions to determine which players have which cards. While this project started as a way to learn and experiment with Python, it ultimately manifested into a way to learn how to make an effective user interface and program with Swift. After almost three months of coding, designing, and debugging, the end product is an IOS App that gives the user the upper hand while playing a game of Clue.
